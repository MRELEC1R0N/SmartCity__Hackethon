# CityWise: Your Smart Urban Companion

![CityWise Logo](link-to-logo-image-if-available)

**CityWise** is a comprehensive mobile application designed to improve urban living by providing real-time news, augmented reality (AR) navigation, mental health support, civic issue reporting, and live economic updates. This smart city companion is built in Kotlin and integrates multiple services to empower users with essential information and tools for modern city life.

---

## Inspiration

CityWise was inspired by the need for a centralized platform where city dwellers can easily access essential information and services. The app combines advanced technology with social impact to enhance the quality of urban life, promote civic engagement, and provide real-time support for mental health and navigation.

---

## Features

- **Live News Updates**: Get real-time news tailored to your city.
- **AR Navigation**: Use augmented reality to navigate the city with ease.
- **Mental Health Chatbot**: Access supportive resources through an empathetic chatbot.
- **Civil Issue Reporting**: Report local issues to authorities directly.
- **Economic Data Insights**: Stay informed with real-time GDP and economic metrics.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Kotlin (Jetpack Compose for UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, REST API
- **Database**: Firebase (cloud storage), Room Database (local storage)
- **APIs**:
  - [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
  - Government Data API for economic metrics
  - Google Maps API for location and navigation
- **Other Tools**: ARCore (for AR features), Redis (for caching), Firebase Analytics (for tracking)

---

## Architecture

The app follows a modular microservices architecture, with each service handling a specific functionality. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Client (Frontend)**: Handles user interaction and AR rendering.
2. **Backend**: Manages API requests, user authentication, and microservices (news, chatbot, government data).
3. **Storage**: Includes a main database for user data and Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
4. **External Services**: Connects to external APIs for news, government data, and maps.

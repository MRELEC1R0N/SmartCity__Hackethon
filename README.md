## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Kotlin (Jetpack Compose for UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, REST API
- **Database**: Firebase (cloud storage), Room Database (local storage)
- **APIs**:
  - [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
  - Government Data API for economic metrics
  - Google Maps API for location and navigation

## Architecture

The app follows a modular microservices architecture, with each service handling a specific functionality. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Client (Frontend)**: Handles user interaction and AR rendering.
2. **Backend**: Manages API requests, user authentication, and microservices (news, chatbot, government data).
3. **Storage**: Includes a main database for user data and Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
4. **External Services**: Connects to external APIs for news, government data, and maps.
